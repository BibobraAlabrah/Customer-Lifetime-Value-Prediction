# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction

# Business Problem
A company wants to know the lifetime value of customers in terms of how much money they will likely bring to the company based on their first few purchase history. 

# Goal
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the customer lifetime value (CLV) for new customers using past purchase history of existing customers.

The prediction model was built using linear regression with an accurate of 90%
